1. INTRODUCTION AND FILE STRUCTURE

This readme introduces my Image Processing API.

1.1 THE BACKEND DIRECTORY

To start the server, enter the 'backend' directory.

Install all dependencies with "npm i"

From the backend, directory:
	The server can be started with "npm start" and accessed at http://localhost:300/api
	Linting is performed with "npm run lint"
	Tests are run with "npm run test"
	The build is created with "npm run build"

TO REPEAT: THE SERVER ADDRESS IS http://localhost:300/api

1.2 THE STORAGE DIRECTORY

Images are stored in the 'storage' directory.  Resized images are in a 'cache' directory after they're made.
The project was supposed to have a front end which could independtly access the storage directory.
Unfortunately I couldn't figure out the front end.

1.3 LICENSES

Currently there are four images in the directory.  All images are taken from Unsplash.com which is completely free to re-use.  The full license is below:

"Unsplash grants you an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from Unsplash for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or Unsplash. This license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service."
